how to add command prefix
1. create [prefix_name].cs file in Scripts/ConsoleCommands directory
2. create CommandsByPrefix object in [prefix_name]_init class. CommandsByPrefix declaration located in CommandsUtil.Cs

static class prefix_name_init
    {
        public static readonly CommandsByPrefix prefix_name_Commands = new CommandsByPrefix
        (
            new ConsoleCommand[]
            {
                new Cmd0(),
                new Cmd1(),
                new Cmd2(),
                new Cmd3()
                
            },
            "prefix_name",
            "Example description that will be shown by calling 'help prefix_name' in console"
        );
    }
   
3. ConsoleCommand array in CommandsByPrefix object must be filled with commands that will be related 
to [prefix_name] prefix. Commands must be created in [prefix_name].cs file
4. Commands are inherited by ConsoleCommand class. ConsoleCommand declaration located in CommandsUtil.Cs

5. to add all commands that are bound to prefix you must call AddCommandsByPref() method in ConsoleBehavior class, 
passing CommandsByPrefix object in [prefix_name]_init class
